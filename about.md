# What is this crap

Banda is a project by [Bill](https://github.com/wphogan) and [Alex](https://github.com/alexharris) that is focused on building easy to use and affordable technology for non-profit and educational institutions.

Our first project is a Wordpress theme for creating documentation, technical or otherwise.

## Why Wordpress?

Wordpress has very low barriers to entry: it is free, well documented, easy to install on my hosts/servers, and has a huge and active community of developers. Tools built for Wordpress are easily accessible.
