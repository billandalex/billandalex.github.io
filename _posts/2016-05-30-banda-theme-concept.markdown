summary: A summary of the final goal of this project
---
Banda Theme (which probably needs a new, more specific, name) aims to be a modern Wordpress theme that strives to serve as an easy to use option for powering internal documentation projects for small projects. Documentation has long been established as an important part of any project that hopes to remain maintainable over a long period of time. Whether it is a style guide, an API, or just organizational best practices, writing down standards in an easily accessible and quickly digestible manner is critical.

This theme hopes to provide a simple, easy to use option for small organizations; non-profits, small businesses, freelancers, etc, who don't necessarily need or have the time to setup and maintain more intensive/expensive options.

An initial list of planned features includes:

* A simple homepage for assisting users in finding the correct documentation they are looking for
* A system for easily organizing entries into a easily navigable hierarchical list/index
* Search
* A simple blog system for development notes, feature announcements, etc

Other possible features for the future include:

* Specific styles/informational organizing for certain types of information, such as a style guide specific option with built in HTML snippet functionality
* Integration of external productivity software such as Trello, Pivotal Tracker, etc to allow for easy access to issues/tickets by non-technical members of an organization.
